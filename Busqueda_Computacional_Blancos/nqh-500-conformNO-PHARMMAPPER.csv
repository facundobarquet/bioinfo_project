Transcription factor activity is modulated by bound coactivator and core,"Genetic variation in AR can be responsible of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) [MIM:109200].;Defects in AR are the cause of androgen insensibility syndrome (AIS) [MIM:300068]; previously known as testicular feminization syndrome (TFM). It can be complete (CAIS) when external genitalia are phenotypically female; or partial (PAIS) when external genitalia are substantively ambiguous or mild (MAIS) when external genitalia are normal male or nearly so.;Defects in AR are the cause of X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) [MIM:313200]; also known as Kennedy disease. In SBMA patients the number of Gln ranges from 40 to 52. Longer expansions result in earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease.;Defects in AR may play a role in metastatic prostate cancer. The mutated receptor stimulates prostate growth and metastases development despite of androgen ablation. This treatment can reduce primary and metastatic lesions probably by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells when they express the wild-type receptor.;Defects in AR may be the cause of infertility male syndrome [MIM:308370]; also called androgen insensitivity. It is characterized by azoospermia, elevated testosterone and luteinizing hormone plasma levels and an abnormal androgen receptor.;Defects in AR are the cause of Reifenstein syndrome [MIM:312300]; also known as partial androgen insensitivity. The features of this form of male pseudohermaphroditism are hypospadias, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, normal XY karyotype, and a pedigree pattern consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance.","Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;Hepatitis B virus infection;Cardiac failure;Andrology;Hirsutism;Female sexual dysfunction;Psoriasis;Reperfusion injury;Plasmodium infection;Atherosclerosis;Prostate hyperplasia;Fatigue;Male sexual dysfunction;Autoimmune disease;Testosterone deficiency;Uterine fibroids;Metabolic disorder;Myalgia;Obesity;Gynecological disorder;Contraception;Cancer;Hypercholesterolemia;Skin burns;Seborrhea;Growth disorder;Bone tumor;Muscular dystrophy;Erectile dysfunction;Systemic lupus erythematosus;Asthma;Wound healing;Cerebrovascular ischemia;Acne;Hypogonadism;HIV infection;Neoplasm;Dermatological disease;Prostate disease;Multiple sclerosis;Lacrimal gland disease;Alopecia;Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection;Ovary cyst;Carcinoma;Cardiovascular disease;Cachexia;Muscle wasting disease;Cervical dystonia;Anemia;Endocrine disease;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Breast tumor;Female contraception;Fungal infection;Cystic fibrosis;Prostate tumor;Estrogen deficiency;Endometriosis;Hormone deficiency;Turners syndrome;Keratosis;Premenstrual syndrome;Hepatitis C virus infection;Benign tumor;Osteoporosis;Male contraception

PHA1 is characterized by urinary salt wasting, resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal dominant form that is mild, and the recessive form which is more severe and due to defects in any of the epithelial sodium channel subunits. In autosomal dominant PHA1 the target organ defect is confined to kidney. Clinical expression can vary from asymptomatic to moderate. It may be severe at birth, but symptoms remit with age. Familial and sporadic cases have been reported.;Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of early onset hypertension with severe exacerbation in pregnancy [MIM:605115]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.

Required for the formation of functional ARID3A DNA-binding complexes.,"Defects in BTK are the cause of X-linked agammaglobulinemia type 1 (XLA) [MIM:300300]. XLA is a humoral immunodeficiency disease which results in developmental defects in the maturation pathway of B-cells. Affected boys have normal levels of pre-B-cells in their bone marrow but virtually no circulating mature B-lymphocytes. This results in a lack of immunoglobulins of all classes and leads to recurrent bacterial infections like otitis, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, sinusitis in the first few years of life, or even some patients present overwhelming sepsis or meningitis, resulting in death in a few hours. Treatment in most cases is by infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin.;Defects in BTK may be the cause of X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency (XLA- IGHD) [MIM:307200]; also known as agammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency or Fleisher syndrome or isolated growth hormone deficiency type 3 (IGHD3). In rare cases XLA is inherited together with isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD).","Autoimmune disease;Lymphoma
