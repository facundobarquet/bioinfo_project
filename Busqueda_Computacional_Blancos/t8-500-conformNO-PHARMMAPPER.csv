It is characterized by blood concentrations of phenylalanine persistently above 1200 mumol (normal concentration 100 mumol) which usually causes mental retardation (unless low phenylalanine diet is introduced early in life). They tend to have light pigmentation, rashes similar to eczema, epilepsy, extreme hyperactivity, psychotic states and an unpleasant mousy odor.;Defects in PAH are the cause of non-phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia (Non-PKU HPA) [MIM:261600]. Non-PKU HPA is a mild form of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency characterized by phenylalanine levels persistently below 600 mumol, which allows normal intellectual and behavioral development without treatment.

Chloride channels have several functions including the regulation of cell volume; membrane potential stabilization, signal transduction and transepithelial transport. May play an important role in renal tubular function.","Defects in CLCN5 are a cause of hypophosphatemic rickets X-linked recessive (XLRH) [MIM:300554]. XLRH is a renal disease belonging to the Dent disease complex, a group of disorders characterized by proximal renal tubular defect, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency. The spectrum of phenotypic features is remarkably similar in the various disorders, except for differences in the severity of bone deformities and renal impairment. XLRH patients present with rickets or osteomalacia, hypophosphatemia due to decreased renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, hypercalciuria, and low molecualr weight proteinuria. Patients develop nephrocalcinosis with progressive renal failure in adulthood. Female carriers may have asymptomatic hypercalciuria or hypophosphatemia only.;Defects in CLCN5 are the cause of nephrolithiasis type 2 (NPHL2) [MIM:300009]; also known as Dent disease 1. NPHL2 is an X- linked recessive renal disease belonging to the Dent disease complex. NPHL2 patients manifest hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia, aminoaciduria, nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency leading to renal failure in adulthood, rickets (33% of patients) and osteomalacia.;Defects in CLCN5 are the cause of nephrolithiasis type 1 (NPHL1) [MIM:310468]; also designated XRN. NPHL1 is an X-linked recessive renal disease belonging to the Dent disease complex. NPHL1 presents with hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, renal stones and renal insufficiency. Patients lack urinary acidification defects, rickets, and osteomalacia.;Defects in CLCN5 are the cause of low molecular weight proteinuria with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (LMWPHN) [MIM:308990]. LMWPHN is an X-linked renal disease belonging to the Dent disease complex. Patients tend to have hypercalciuric nephrocalcinosis without rickets or renal failure.","NONE
