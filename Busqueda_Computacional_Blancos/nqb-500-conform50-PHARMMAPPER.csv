MPS6 is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease characterized by intracellular accumulation of dermatan sulfate. Clinical features can include abnormal growth, short stature, stiff joints, skeletal malformations, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiac abnormalities. A wide variation in clinical severity is observed.;Arylsulfatase B activity is defective in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) [MIM:272200]. MSD is a disorder characterized by decreased activity of all known sulfatases. MSD is due to defects in SUMF1 resulting in the lack of post- translational modification of a highly conserved cysteine into 3- oxoalanine. It combines features of individual sulfatase deficiencies such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, mucopolysaccharidosis, chondrodysplasia punctata, hydrocephalus, ichthyosis, neurologic deterioration and developmental delay.","NONE

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by control,"TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers.;Defects in TP53 are involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [MIM:133239]. ESCC is a tumor of the esophagus.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]. LFS is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.;Defects in TP53 may be associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma [MIM:161550]; also known as nasopharyngeal cancer.;Defects in TP53 are found in Barrett metaplasia; also known as Barrett esophagus. It is a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.;Defects in TP53 are involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) [MIM:275355].;Defects in TP53 are involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Cigarette smoke is a prime mutagenic agent in cancer of the aerodigestive tract.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of lung cancer [MIM:211980].;Defects in TP53 are a cause of choroid plexus papilloma [MIM:260500]. Choroid plexus papilloma is a slow-growing benign tumor of the choroid plexus that often invades the leptomeninges. In children it is usually in a lateral ventricle but in adults it is more often in the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus is common, either from obstruction or from tumor secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. If it undergoes malignant transformation it is called a choroid plexus carcinoma. Primary choroid plexus tumors are rare and usually occur in early childhood.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of one form of hereditary adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) [MIM:202300]. ADCC is a rare childhood tumor, representing about 0.4% of childhood tumors, with a high incidence of associated tumors. ADCC occurs with increased frequency in patients with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [MIM:130650] and is a component tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome [MIM:151623].","NONE

The effect of MC is to increase ion and water tr,"Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type I (PHA1) [MIM:177735]. PHA1 is characterized by urinary salt wasting, resulting from target organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal dominant form that is mild, and the recessive form which is more severe and due to defects in any of the epithelial sodium channel subunits. In autosomal dominant PHA1 the target organ defect is confined to kidney. Clinical expression can vary from asymptomatic to moderate. It may be severe at birth, but symptoms remit with age. Familial and sporadic cases have been reported.;Defects in NR3C2 are a cause of early onset hypertension with severe exacerbation in pregnancy [MIM:605115]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. The disease is characterized by the onset of severe hypertension before the age of 20, and by suppression of aldosterone secretion.","Metabolic disorder;Hypertension;Cardiovascular disease;Urinary tract disease

Isoform Short has a higher affinity for insulin. Mediates the metabolic functions of insulin. Binding to insulin stimulates association of the receptor with downstream mediators inclu,"Defects in INSR are the cause of insulin resistance (Ins resistance) [MIM:125853].;Defects in INSR are the cause of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome [MIM:262190]; also known as Mendenhall syndrome. It is a severe insulin resistance syndrome characterized by insulin- resistant diabetes mellitus with pineal hyperplasia and somatic abnormalities. Typical features include coarse, senile-appearing facies, dental and skin abnormalities, abdominal distension, and phallic enlargement. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR are the cause of leprechaunism [MIM:246200]; also known as Donohue syndrome. Leprechaunism represents the most severe form of insulin resistance syndrome, characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation and death in early infancy. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR may be associated with noninsulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [MIM:125853]; also known as diabetes mellitus type 2.;Defects in INSR are the cause of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 5 (HHF5) [MIM:609968]. Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [MIM:256450], also referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism, nesidioblastosis, or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PPHI), is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and is due to defective negative feedback regulation of insulin secretion by low glucose levels.;Defects in INSR are the cause of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans type A (IRAN type A) [MIM:610549]. This syndrome is characterized by the association of severe insulin resistance (manifested by marked hyperinsulinemia and a failure to respond to exogenous insulin) with the skin lesion acanthosis nigricans and ovarian hyperandrogenism in adolescent female subjects. Women frequently present with hirsutism, acne, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and virilization. This syndrome is different from the type B that has been demonstrated to be secondary to the presence of circulating autoantibodies against the insulin receptor.","Insulin dependent diabetes;Cancer;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Infection;Parkinsons disease;Hypertension;Diabetes mellitus;Hyperinsulinemia

RCAD is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising (1) nondiabetic renal disease resulting from abnormal renal development, and (2) diabetes, which in some cases occurs earlier than age 25 years and is thus consistent with a diagnosis of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The renal disease is highly variable and includes renal cysts, glomerular tufts, aberrant nephrogenesis, primitive tubules, irregular collecting systems, oligomeganephronia, enlarged renal pelves, abnormal calyces, small kidney, single kidney, horseshoe kidney, and hyperuricemic nephropathy.;Defects in HNF1B are a cause of Muellerian aplasia [MIM:158330].

Isoforms lacking a transmembrane domain, such as isoform 2 and isoform 3, may function as decoy receptors for VEGFA, VEGFC and/or VEGFD. Isoform 2 plays an important role as negative regulator of VEGFA- and VEGFC-mediated lymphangiogenesis by limiting the amount of free VEGFA and/or VEGFC and preventing their binding to FLT4. Modulates FLT1 and FLT4 signaling by forming heterodimers. Binding of vascular growth factors to isoform 1 leads to the activation of several signaling cascades.
