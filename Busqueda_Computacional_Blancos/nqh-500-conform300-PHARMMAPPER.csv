In the presence of a correct codon-anticodon match between the aminoacyl-tRNA and the A-site codon of the ribosome-bound mRNA, the ribosome acts as a GTPase activator and the GTP is hydrolyzed. The inactive GDP-bound form leaves the ribosome and must be recycled by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) (eEF1B subcomplex) before binding another molecule of aminoacyl-tRNA. Required for nuclear export of aminoacyl-tRNAs. May also be involved in translational quality control by targeting cotranslationally damaged proteins to the proteasome.

Clinical features can include abnormal growth, short stature, stiff joints, skeletal malformations, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiac abnormalities. A wide variation in clinical severity is observed.;Arylsulfatase B activity is defective in multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) [MIM:272200]. MSD is a disorder characterized by decreased activity of all known sulfatases. MSD is due to defects in SUMF1 resulting in the lack of post- translational modification of a highly conserved cysteine into 3- oxoalanine.

Isoform Short has a higher affinity for insulin. Mediates the metabolic functions of insulin. Binding to insulin stimulates association of the receptor with downstream mediators inclu,"Defects in INSR are the cause of insulin resistance (Ins resistance) [MIM:125853].;Defects in INSR are the cause of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome [MIM:262190]; also known as Mendenhall syndrome. It is a severe insulin resistance syndrome characterized by insulin- resistant diabetes mellitus with pineal hyperplasia and somatic abnormalities. Typical features include coarse, senile-appearing facies, dental and skin abnormalities, abdominal distension, and phallic enlargement. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR are the cause of leprechaunism [MIM:246200]; also known as Donohue syndrome. Leprechaunism represents the most severe form of insulin resistance syndrome, characterized by intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation and death in early infancy. Inheritance is autosomal recessive.;Defects in INSR may be associated with noninsulin- dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) [MIM:125853]; also known as diabetes mellitus type 2.;Defects in INSR are the cause of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia 5 (HHF5) [MIM:609968]. Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [MIM:256450], also referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism, nesidioblastosis, or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PPHI), is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and is due to defective negative feedback regulation of insulin secretion by low glucose levels.;Defects in INSR are the cause of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus with acanthosis nigricans type A (IRAN type A) [MIM:610549]. This syndrome is characterized by the association of severe insulin resistance (manifested by marked hyperinsulinemia and a failure to respond to exogenous insulin) with the skin lesion acanthosis nigricans and ovarian hyperandrogenism in adolescent female subjects. Women frequently present with hirsutism, acne, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, and virilization. This syndrome is different from the type B that has been demonstrated to be secondary to the presence of circulating autoantibodies against the insulin receptor.","Insulin dependent diabetes;Cancer;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Infection;Parkinsons disease;Hypertension;Diabetes mellitus;Hyperinsulinemia

Transcription factor activity is modulated by bound coactivator and core,"Genetic variation in AR can be responsible of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) [MIM:109200].;Defects in AR are the cause of androgen insensibility syndrome (AIS) [MIM:300068]; previously known as testicular feminization syndrome (TFM). It can be complete (CAIS) when external genitalia are phenotypically female; or partial (PAIS) when external genitalia are substantively ambiguous or mild (MAIS) when external genitalia are normal male or nearly so.;Defects in AR are the cause of X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) [MIM:313200]; also known as Kennedy disease. In SBMA patients the number of Gln ranges from 40 to 52. Longer expansions result in earlier onset and more severe clinical manifestations of the disease.;Defects in AR may play a role in metastatic prostate cancer. The mutated receptor stimulates prostate growth and metastases development despite of androgen ablation. This treatment can reduce primary and metastatic lesions probably by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells when they express the wild-type receptor.;Defects in AR may be the cause of infertility male syndrome [MIM:308370]; also called androgen insensitivity. It is characterized by azoospermia, elevated testosterone and luteinizing hormone plasma levels and an abnormal androgen receptor.;Defects in AR are the cause of Reifenstein syndrome [MIM:312300]; also known as partial androgen insensitivity. The features of this form of male pseudohermaphroditism are hypospadias, hypogonadism, gynecomastia, normal XY karyotype, and a pedigree pattern consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance.","Hypoactive sexual desire disorder;Hepatitis B virus infection;Cardiac failure;Andrology;Hirsutism;Female sexual dysfunction;Psoriasis;Reperfusion injury;Plasmodium infection;Atherosclerosis;Prostate hyperplasia;Fatigue;Male sexual dysfunction;Autoimmune disease;Testosterone deficiency;Uterine fibroids;Metabolic disorder;Myalgia;Obesity;Gynecological disorder;Contraception;Cancer;Hypercholesterolemia;Skin burns;Seborrhea;Growth disorder;Bone tumor;Muscular dystrophy;Erectile dysfunction;Systemic lupus erythematosus;Asthma;Wound healing;Cerebrovascular ischemia;Acne;Hypogonadism;HIV infection;Neoplasm;Dermatological disease;Prostate disease;Multiple sclerosis;Lacrimal gland disease;Alopecia;Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection;Ovary cyst;Carcinoma;Cardiovascular disease;Cachexia;Muscle wasting disease;Cervical dystonia;Anemia;Endocrine disease;Non-insulin dependent diabetes;Breast tumor;Female contraception;Fungal infection;Cystic fibrosis;Prostate tumor;Estrogen deficiency;Endometriosis;Hormone deficiency;Turners syndrome;Keratosis;Premenstrual syndrome;Hepatitis C virus infection;Benign tumor;Osteoporosis;Male contraception
