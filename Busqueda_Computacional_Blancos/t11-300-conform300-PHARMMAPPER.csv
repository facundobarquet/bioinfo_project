Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by control,"TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers.;Defects in TP53 are involved in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [MIM:133239]. ESCC is a tumor of the esophagus.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]. LFS is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers.;Defects in TP53 may be associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma [MIM:161550]; also known as nasopharyngeal cancer.;Defects in TP53 are found in Barrett metaplasia; also known as Barrett esophagus. It is a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.;Defects in TP53 are involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) [MIM:275355].;Defects in TP53 are involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Cigarette smoke is a prime mutagenic agent in cancer of the aerodigestive tract.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of lung cancer [MIM:211980].;Defects in TP53 are a cause of choroid plexus papilloma [MIM:260500]. Choroid plexus papilloma is a slow-growing benign tumor of the choroid plexus that often invades the leptomeninges. In children it is usually in a lateral ventricle but in adults it is more often in the fourth ventricle. Hydrocephalus is common, either from obstruction or from tumor secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. If it undergoes malignant transformation it is called a choroid plexus carcinoma. Primary choroid plexus tumors are rare and usually occur in early childhood.;Defects in TP53 are a cause of one form of hereditary adrenocortical carcinoma (ADCC) [MIM:202300]. ADCC is a rare childhood tumor, representing about 0.4% of childhood tumors, with a high incidence of associated tumors. ADCC occurs with increased frequency in patients with the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome [MIM:130650] and is a component tumor in Li-Fraumeni syndrome [MIM:151623].","NONE
